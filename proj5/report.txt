The complecity of this algorithm is based mostly off the BFS and spell_word whichI believe is O(VE^2) where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges i believe it is E^2 because of the use of back edges. The list holds our queue of nodes that also contains an adjacency list in the class.


My contrabutions involve the creation of BFS Spell_word and debuging.
